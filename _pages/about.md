<!-- My research centers on empirical analysis in various machine learning domains, with a particular emphasis on understanding and analyzing large language models (LLMs) and other transformer-based architectures.  -->

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/), advised by Professors [Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) and [John Dickerson](https://jpdickerson.com/). 
My research interests cover a range of machine learning topics, including but not limited to: LLM reasoning, adversarial attacks, and efficient implementation of transformer architectures. 
I am especially interested in exploring the extent to which LLMs understand context, reason strategically, and generalize beyond their training data.

During the summer of 2024, I was an Applied Research intern at Capital One as part of the Behavior Modeling team where I explored using transformers for event prediction.

Before joining UMD, I was a Vice President in Algorithmic Research and Development at RBC Capital Markets in New York City, where I focused on enhancing the intelligence and infrastructure behind the Equities divisionâ€™s proprietary execution platform. 
This role gave me hands-on experience with applying problem solving skills to real-world production systems.

I hold a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Operations Research from Columbia University. For more details, you can view my [CV](/assets/pdf/Resume.pdf).
